      <p>This should be my bio, so I'ma talk about me a bit here. Well, hi my name's Adam as you might know by now and I was born in 1998,
        I left university earlier in november 2018 (was studying IT), because it just wans't for me, at least that's what I thought at the moment. Now I'm trying to get back in the computer bussiness with web developing.
